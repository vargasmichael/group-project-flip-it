# Game Play
 
- You must have 3 cards in your hand at all times. 
- When it is your turn, you must play a card that is equal to or higher than the card on top of the played cards pile. (Unless it is a 7)
- You are allowed to play multiples of the same card.
- If at any point there are 4 of the same card in a row it acts like the 10 and deletes the played cards pile.
- You must play a card if you are able. 
- If you are unable to play a card, you must take the played cards pile and add it to your hand.
- Once all the cards from your hand and played cards pile are gone, you are then allowed to play the cards that are face up in front of you.
- If you take the played cards pile during this time, you must play all the cards from your hand before you can play the cards that are face up in front of you.
- Once those are gone you are allowed to play the cards that are face down in front of you. Those cards are blind flips and you must show the cards to the players. 
- First person to get rid of all their cards wins.
