npm install --save-dev jest

Create a test file: Create a new file in your project's src directory with a .test.js or .spec.js extension. This is where you will write your tests. For example, if you want to test a component called MyComponent, you could create a file called MyComponent.test.js.

use Jest's test function to define a test case. For example, to test that MyComponent renders correctly, you could write:
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

test('renders correctly', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
  const linkElement = getByText(/Hello, World!/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});


This test uses render from @testing-library/react to render MyComponent and then checks that the text "Hello, World!" is present in the component's output.

next: Run your tests: You can run your tests by running the following command in your terminal:

npm test
This will run all test files that match the pattern *.test.js or *.spec.js in your project.
